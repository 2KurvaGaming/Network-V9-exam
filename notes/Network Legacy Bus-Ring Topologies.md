# Ⓜ️ Most modern networks use the ⭐ star topology due to its reliability and scalability. 

  However, there are **2 legacy topologies**         that you should still be familiar with: **Bus topology and the Ring topology**. 
- Although these topologies may no longer be in widespread use, you will still often find them in legacy systems or in specific niche     situations.⭐

# 🚌 Bus Typology
<img width="133" height="75" alt="bus_topology" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01da8336-41d2-44fc-9ed0-c51490a68f10" />

### 🌐 **BUS TOPOLOGY** 🚌  
🔹 **What It Is**:  
📡 A bus topology consists of a trunk cable with nodes either inserted directly into the trunk or tapped into the trunk using offshoot cables called drop cables (coaxial cables. 
- A device called a terminator is placed at both ends of the trunk cable. (BNC Connector or **T** Connectors)
  
 <img width="815" height="519" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 123625" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0cb8e3-3f06-405d-a7ea-93a5c38fd902" />
 
- Their purpose is to absorb signals, preventing them from reflecting repeatedly back and forth on the cable.
- Signals travel from one node to all other nodes.
- The major downside of using a bus topology is that a broken cable anywhere on the bus breaks the termination and prevents               communications between all devices on the network.
- This can make it difficult to isolate cabling problems.

👉 All devices are connected to a **single central cable** — the “bus” or “backbone”! 🚍💻  
🎯 Like houses on a street sharing one main road! 🛣️🏠  

✅ **How It Works**:  
• Data travels along the backbone 📤  
• Every device *checks* if the data is for them 👀  
• Simple & straightforward — perfect for small networks! 🏢  

🌟 **Pros**:  
✔️ **Easy to set up** — great for beginners! 🧩  
✔️ **Low cost** — uses less cable 💰  
✔️ Perfect for **small LANs** (like a classroom or small office) 🏫💼  

💥 **Cons**:  
❌ **Single point of failure** — if the main cable breaks, the *whole network goes down* 😱  
❌ Can get **slow with traffic** — like a traffic jam on the info highway! 🚗🚦  
❌ Not scalable — doesn’t work well for big networks 📉  
❌ ***REQUIRES** The use of a terminator at both ends of the Backbone 🩻 
❌ To remain operational, there must NOT be any OPEN connections 📉 
    -  Including the ends that attach to the computers.
👉 For Example, if a computer is removed or if the terminators are loose or missing, then the cable would be OPEN and data would           **bounce back**. 
🪞 This bounce is known as ***Signal Reflection***
  - If this happens. Data Flow would be disrupted.
    
🚫 **Best For**:  
👉 Small, temporary, or simple networks only!  
🚫 Not ideal for large businesses or high-traffic areas!

###### The image depicts a bus topology in a computer network. There is a single straight horizontal cable (the trunk), represented by a blue line. Along this cable, there are four evenly spaced orange and red cubes, symbolizing network nodes or devices. Each node is directly attached to the trunk cable, either resting on or connected by short lines. The cable ends do not visibly show terminators in this simplified representation, but the implication is they would be at either end of the blue cable to prevent signal reflection. This arrangement demonstrates that all nodes share the same communication line, characteristic of bus topology networks.

### 🔁 **RING TOPOLOGY** 🔄
<img width="126" height="112" alt="ring_topology" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86640ee0-1d07-4524-832e-a3088ab5b301" />

🔹 **What It Is**:  
💍  A ring topology connects neighboring nodes until they form a ring or a circle. 
  - Signals travel in **one direction** around the ring, with each device on the network acting as a repeater to send the signal to the next device. 
  - Because a continuous ring is required, the installation of this topology requires careful planning. A node malfunction or cable break can prevent signals from reaching nodes beyond the malfunction.
  - This interconnectedness can cause difficulties with problem isolation, requiring the troubleshooter to check several physical locations along the ring.

👉 Devices are connected in a **closed loop** — each one linked to * EXACTLY Two Others*!  
🎯 Data travels in **one direction** (usually) — like a digital conga line! 🕺💃  

🌀 **How It Works**:  
• Uses **token passing** — only the device with the “token” can send data 🪙📤  
• Super organized — no data collisions! 🚫💥  
• Common in older tech like **IBM Token Ring** networks 🖳  

🌟 **Pros**:  
✔️ **Predictable performance** — no data crashes! 🚗✅  
✔️ **Equal access** for all devices — fair & balanced ⚖️  
✔️ Good for **moderate traffic** environments 📊  

💥 **Cons**:  
❌ **One device fails? Whole network suffers!** 😵‍💫  
❌ Adding/removing devices can **disrupt the ring** 🛠️⚠️  
❌ Harder to troubleshoot than other topologies 🔍💔  

🚫 **Best For**:  
👉 Used in older systems or specialized networks  
🚫 Rarely used today — mostly replaced by faster, more reliable setups (like Star)

###### The image shows a visual representation of a ring topology network. Five orange square-shaped nodes are evenly spaced in a circular arrangement. Each node is connected to its adjacent nodes by blue lines, forming a continuous loop or ring. The design illustrates how each node is linked to exactly two neighbors, reinforcing the concept described in the preceding text where signals circulate in one direction and each device acts as a repeater. The layout visually demonstrates that if any single connection or node were disrupted, communication beyond that point would be affected, in line with the challenges noted in the text. There are no directional arrows or other labels present in the image.

### 🆚 **Bus vs. Ring: Quick Comparison** 🤔  

| Feature               | **Bus** 🚌              | **Ring** 🔁               |

| **Shape**             | Straight line 📏         | Closed loop 🔄            |
| **Data Flow**         | Both directions ↔️       | One direction ➡️ (usually) |

| **Setup Ease**        | Super easy! 🎯          | More complex 🧠           |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | Low — cable = weak spot 😬 | Low — one break = big oops! 😬 |
| **Used Today?**       | Rarely 📉               | Mostly outdated 🕰️        |

🎯 **Final Verdict**:  
While Bus and Ring were 💫pioneers✨ in early networking, today’s networks usually prefer **Star** or **Hybrid** topologies for better reliability & speed! ⚡ But knowing these is still 🔑 for exams, certs (like Network+! 📜), and understanding how networking evolved! 📚💡
