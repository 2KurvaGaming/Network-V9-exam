<h1 align="center">Layer 3 Network</h1>

# 🥅 Layer 3 is the Network layer. 
## This layer is responsible for moving data around a network of networks, known as an internetwork. 

🧩 Main Responsibilities of the Network Layer
The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for enabling communication between devices on different networks — not just within the same local network. 

While Layer 2 (Data Link) handles communication within a single network using MAC addresses

📌 Layer 3 steps 🪜 up by using logical IP addresses to identify source and destination devices across interconnected networks, such as the internet.

## 💪 Its primary job is routing:
  - Determining the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination, possibly through multiple routers and networks
  - It encapsulates data from the Transport Layer into packets and adds a header containing the source and destination IP addresses.
  - Routers then read this header to make forwarding decisions
  - Supports both unicast and multicast traffic
    
💥 Without Layer 3, large-scale networks like the internet simply wouldn’t function.




























# 🔢 What is **Logical Addressing**?  

**Logical addressing** refers to the use of **software-based, hierarchical addresses** assigned to devices in a network to enable **communication across multiple networks**. Unlike physical (hardware) addresses, logical addresses are **not tied to hardware** and can be changed or reassigned.

> ✅ **Most Common Example**: **IP addresses** (IPv4 or IPv6)

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | To uniquely identify devices on a network and allow routing between different networks 🌐 |
| **Assigned By** | Network administrators or automatically via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) |
| **Layer in OSI** | **Layer 3 – Network Layer** |
| **Example** | `192.168.1.10` (IPv4), `2001:db8::1` (IPv6) |

## 🔁 Logical vs. Physical Addressing

| **Logical Address (IP)** | **Physical Address (MAC)** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Assigned by software/network | Burned into hardware (NIC) |
| Can be changed | Unique and permanent (usually) |
| Used for **routing across networks** | Used for **delivery within a local network** |
| Operates at **Layer 3** | Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link)** |
| Example: `10.0.0.5` | Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` |

> 🔄 **How They Work Together**:  
> When you send data, your device uses the **destination IP address** to determine *where* the data should go (logical).
> Then, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** finds the matching **MAC address** so the data can be sent on the local network             (physical).

## 🌍 Why Logical Addressing Matters

1. **Enables Internetworking**  
   Allows devices on **different networks** (e.g., your home, office, internet) to communicate.

2. **Supports Routing**  
   Routers use **IP addresses** to decide how to forward packets across the internet.

3. **Hierarchical Structure**  
   IP addresses are structured (network + host parts), making routing efficient.  
   Example: In `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.1` is the network, `.10` is the host.

4. **Scalability**  
   Millions of devices can be addressed globally using IPv4 and virtually unlimited with IPv6.

## 📦 Types of Logical Addresses

| Type | Format | Length | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **IPv4** | Dotted decimal (e.g., `172.16.25.1`) | 32-bit | Most widely used; limited supply |
| **IPv6** | Hexadecimal (e.g., `fe80::1`) | 128-bit | Future standard; vast address space |
| **Private IPs** | `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x` | — | Used inside local networks |
| **Public IPs** | Globally unique | — | Used on the internet |

---

## 🗝️ **Key Protocols & Technologies**

| Protocol | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | Core protocol for addressing and routing | IPv4 (most common), IPv6 (future-proof) |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Used for diagnostics (`ping`, `traceroute`) | Not for user data |
| **ARP** ⚠️ | Maps IP → MAC (operates at Layer 2/3 boundary) | Critical for local delivery |
| **RIP, OSPF, EIGRP** | **Routing protocols** – help routers learn best paths | OSPF is link-state; EIGRP is Cisco-proprietary |
| **IGMP** | Manages multicast group memberships | Used in video streaming, online gaming |


## 🎯 Exam Tips (CompTIA Network+, CCNA, etc.)

- ✅ **Layer 3 = Logical Addressing = IP Addressing**
- ✅ **Routers use logical addresses** to forward packets between networks.
- ✅ Know the difference between **public vs. private IP addresses**.
- ✅ Understand that **IP is connectionless and unreliable** — it doesn’t guarantee delivery (that’s Transport Layer’s job).
- ✅ Be familiar with **IPv4 classes** (A, B, C) and **CIDR notation** (e.g., `/24`).
- ✅ **DHCP** assigns logical addresses automatically; **static IP** means manual assignment.

## 🧠 Quick Summary

> **Logical addressing = IP addressing = How devices are found across networks.**  
> It’s the foundation of routing and internetwork communication — essential for any network certification.

📌 **Remember**:  
> 🌐 *Physical address (MAC) = Who you are (locally)*  
> 🌍 *Logical address (IP) = Where you are (globally)
