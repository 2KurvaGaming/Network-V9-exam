<h1 align="center">Layer 3 Network</h1>

# 🥅 Layer 3 is the Network layer. 

### (Logical network addressing and forwarding.)

## This layer is responsible for moving data around a network of networks, known as an internetwork. 

🧩 Main Responsibilities of the Network Layer
The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for enabling communication between devices on different networks — not just within the same local network. 

While Layer 2 (Data Link) handles communication within a single network using MAC addresses

📌 Layer 3 steps 🪜 up by using logical IP addresses to identify source and destination devices across interconnected networks, such as the internet.

## 💪 Its primary job is routing:
  - Determining the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination
  - Functionality at the network layer is provided through routing protocols which are software components.
  - Route Selection: determining best path for the data to travel throughout the network
  - It encapsulates data from the Transport Layer into packets and adds a header containing the source and destination IP addresses.
  - Supports both unicast and multicast traffic
  - At layer 3, each packet is given a destination network address. Routers are configured with information about how to reach these different logical networks. The packet is forwarded, router by router (or hop by hop), through the internetwork to the target network. Once it has reached the destination network, the hardware address can be used to deliver the packet to the target node.

## 🕸️ Routes can be configured in 2 Ways:

| **Routing Type** | **Definition**                                                                                                      | **Scalability**                                      | **Fault Tolerance**                                               |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static**       | Routes are manually configured by a network administrator and do not change unless updated manually.                | Suitable for small, stable networks with minimal changes. | No automatic failover; link failure disrupts connectivity unless manually rerouted. |
| **Dynamic**      | Routes are automatically updated based on changes in network topology using routing protocols.                      | Ideal for large, complex networks where topology changes frequently. | Supports automatic rerouting and failover upon link failure, ensuring continuous connectivity. |

💥 At layer 3, each packet is given a destination network address. Routers are configured with information about how to reach these different logical networks. The packet is forwarded, router by router (or hop by hop), through the internetwork to the target network. Once it has reached the destination network, the hardware address can be used to deliver the packet to the target node.
    
💥 Without Layer 3, large-scale networks like the internet simply wouldn’t function.

###### The image illustrates communication at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model by depicting two separate networks (Network 1 and Network 2) each connected to a router (Router A and Router B, respectively). Network 1 consists of three computers with addresses 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, all connected to Router A (interface 1.254). Network 2 has three computers with addresses 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, all connected to Router B (interface 2.254).

---

###### Routers A and B are themselves connected to each other via a third network, Network 9, with IP addresses 9.254 (Router A) and 9.253 (Router B).

###### The diagram follows the path of a packet as it travels from host 1.2 (in Network 1) to host 2.3 (in Network 2). The following steps are highlighted by numbered captions:

###### At the network layer, each interface on a router is identified by an address with a network part and a host part (e.g., 1.254 for Router A's interface on Network 1).

###### When host 1.2 wants to send information to host 2.3, the packet must be delivered through the routers (via Network 9) since the destination is on a different network.

###### Networks 1 and 2 are connected via an intermediate network, labeled Network 9.

###### Router B recognizes that Network 2 is directly connected and uses data link protocols to forward the packet to host 2.3.

###### Dashed arrows indicate the route the packet takes: from host 1.2 to Router A, through Network 9 to Router B, and finally to host 2.3 in Network 2.

# 🔢 What is **Logical Addressing**?  

**Logical addressing** refers to the use of **software-based, hierarchical addresses** assigned to devices in a network to enable **communication across multiple networks**. Unlike physical (hardware) addresses, logical addresses are **not tied to hardware** and can be changed or reassigned.

> ✅ **Most Common Example**: **IP addresses** (IPv4 or IPv6)

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | To uniquely identify devices on a network and allow routing between different networks 🌐 |
| **Assigned By** | Network administrators or automatically via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) |
| **Layer in OSI** | **Layer 3 – Network Layer** |
| **Example** | `192.168.1.10` (IPv4), `2001:db8::1` (IPv6) |

---

## 🔁 Logical vs. Physical Addressing

| **Logical Address (IP)** | **Physical Address (MAC)** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Assigned by software/network | Burned into hardware (NIC) |
| Can be changed | Unique and permanent (usually) |
| Used for **routing across networks** | Used for **delivery within a local network** |
| Operates at **Layer 3** | Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link)** |
| Example: `10.0.0.5` | Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` |

> 🔄 **How They Work Together**:  
> When you send data, your device uses the **destination IP address** to determine *where* the data should go (logical).
> Then, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** finds the matching **MAC address** so the data can be sent on the local network             (physical).

---

## 🌍 Why Logical Addressing Matters

1. **Enables Internetworking**  
   Allows devices on **different networks** (e.g., your home, office, internet) to communicate.

2. **Supports Routing**  
   Routers use **IP addresses** to decide how to forward packets across the internet.

3. **Hierarchical Structure**  
   IP addresses are structured (network + host parts), making routing efficient.  
   Example: In `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.1` is the network, `.10` is the host.

4. **Scalability**  
   Millions of devices can be addressed globally using IPv4 and virtually unlimited with IPv6.

## 📦 Types of Logical Addresses

| Type | Format | Length | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **IPv4** | Dotted decimal (e.g., `172.16.25.1`) | 32-bit | Most widely used; limited supply |
| **IPv6** | Hexadecimal (e.g., `fe80::1`) | 128-bit | Future standard; vast address space |
| **Private IPs** | `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x` | — | Used inside local networks |
| **Public IPs** | Globally unique | — | Used on the internet |

## 🗝️ **Key Protocols & Technologies**

| Protocol | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | Core protocol for addressing and routing | IPv4 (most common), IPv6 (future-proof) |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Used for diagnostics (`ping`, `traceroute`) | Not for user data |
| **ARP** ⚠️ | Maps IP → MAC (operates at Layer 2/3 boundary) | Critical for local delivery |
| **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** | Distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count to determine best path | Max 15 hops; best for small, simple networks |
| **SPF (Shortest Path First)** | Algorithm used by link-state protocols to calculate the shortest path to a destination | Core of OSPF; recalculates dynamically when network changes occur |
| **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** | Link-state routing protocol that builds a complete map of the network for fast convergence | Uses SPF algorithm; scalable for large enterprise networks |
| **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** | Advanced distance-vector protocol that uses multiple metrics (bandwidth, delay) to find best path | Cisco-proprietary; fast convergence and loop-free routing |
| **IGMP** | Manages multicast group memberships | Used in video streaming, online gaming |
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | Core protocol for addressing and routing | IPv4 (most common), IPv6 (future-proof) |
| **RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)** | Maps a MAC address to an IP address | Used in older networks; largely replaced by BOOTP and DHCP |
| **ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)** | High-speed cell-based networking for voice, video, and data | Uses fixed-size cells (53 bytes); common in legacy WANs |
| **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)** | Link-state routing protocol for routing data within a network | Commonly used in large ISPs and backbone networks; works well with OSI model |
| **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)** | Secures IP communications by authenticating and encrypting packets | Operates at Network layer; often used in VPNs |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Reports errors and sends operational info for IP networks | Used by tools like `ping` and `traceroute` |
| **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)** | Speeds up and shapes network traffic flows | Uses labels instead of IP addresses for fast forwarding; sits between Layers 2 and 3 |



## 🧠 Quick Summary

> **Logical addressing = IP addressing = How devices are found across networks.**  
> It’s the foundation of routing and internetwork communication — essential for any network certification.

📌 **Remember**:  
> 🌐 *Physical address (MAC) = Who you are (locally)*  
> 🌍 *Logical address (IP) = Where you are (globally)

> - **Switches** = same network (Layer 2) → use **MAC addresses**  
> - **Routers** = different networks (Layer 3) → use **IP addresses**

> - **Router** 🔄 – The **primary device** that operates at Layer 3. Makes decisions based on **IP addresses**.
> - **Layer 3 Switch** ⚡ – A switch with routing capabilities. Common for **inter-VLAN routing** in enterprise networks.

🧭 Key Takeaway: Routers = Traffic Directors
Each router interface has an IP address (e.g., 1.254, 2.254, 9.254).
Routers forward packets based on network prefixes, not just IPs.
They use intermediate networks (like Network 9) to link distant parts of the internet.
End-to-end delivery? It’s a team effort across layers and devices!

## 🎯 Exam Tips (CompTIA Network+, CCNA, etc.)

- ✅ **Layer 3 = Logical Addressing = IP Addressing**
- ✅ **Routers use logical addresses** to forward packets between networks.
- ✅ Know the difference between **public vs. private IP addresses**.
- ✅ Understand that **IP is connectionless and unreliable** — it doesn’t guarantee delivery (that’s Transport Layer’s job).
- ✅ Be familiar with **IPv4 classes** (A, B, C) and **CIDR notation** (e.g., `/24`).
- ✅ **DHCP** assigns logical addresses automatically; **static IP** means manual assignment.
