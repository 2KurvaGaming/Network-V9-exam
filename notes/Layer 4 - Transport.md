# Layer 4 is Transport 

üéâ **MISSION: LAYER 4 ‚Äì THE TRANSPORT LAYER**  
üî• *"The Traffic Controller of the Internet Highway"*  
üö¶ **Ensures data arrives *complete*, *correct*, and *in order***  

Layer 4 Transport ‚Äî where reliability meets speed, and your data gets its travel agent, quality inspector, and delivery scheduler all in one. üíªüöÄ

### üåê **What Is the Transport Layer? (Layer 4)**

> **üí° Definition**:  
> The **Transport Layer** (Layer 4 of the OSI model) is responsible for **end-to-end communication**, ensuring data is delivered **reliably, in sequence, and without errors** between two hosts ‚Äî *regardless of the underlying network*.

It‚Äôs like the **postmaster general** of the internet: doesn‚Äôt deliver the mail itself, but makes sure it‚Äôs packed right, tracked, and resent if lost.

### üß© **Key Responsibilities of the Transport Layer**

| ‚úÖ Function | üìù Description |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Error Checking** | ‚úÖ Full error detection + correction | ‚úÖ Error detection only (no fix) |
| **Service Addressing** | Uses port numbers to identify specific applications or services on a device (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). Enables multiple apps to communicate simultaneously over the same network connection ‚Äî like different apartment units sharing one building address (IP). üîåüéØ |
| **Segmentation & Reassembly** | Breaks data from upper layers into *segments* (for TCP) or *datagrams* (for UDP), then reassembles at the destination. |
| **Flow Control** | Prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver (like a traffic regulator). üö¶ |
| **Error Control** | Detects and retransmits lost/corrupted data (TCP only). ‚úÖüîÅ |
| **Congestion Control** | Slows down transmission if the network is overloaded (TCP). üõëüö¶ |
| **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing** | Uses **port numbers** to deliver data to the correct application (e.g., web vs email). üîÑüì¶ |
| **Connection Management** | Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections (TCP uses 3-way handshake). üîó |

### üöÜ **The Two Main Protocols: TCP vs UDP**

> üé≠ *"The Reliable Truck vs The Speedy Motorcycle"*

| **Feature** | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** üöõ | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** üèçÔ∏è |
|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type** | ‚úÖ Connection-oriented (handshake first) | ‚ùå Connectionless (fire and forget) |
| **Reliability** | ‚úÖ Guaranteed delivery with ACKs & retransmissions | ‚ùå Best-effort (no guarantees) |
| **Ordering** | ‚úÖ Data arrives in order | ‚ùå No guaranteed order |
| **Error Checking** | ‚úÖ Full error detection + correction | ‚úÖ Error detection only (no fix) |
| **Flow Control** | ‚úÖ Yes (sliding window) | ‚ùå No |
| **Congestion Control** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Speed** | ‚è±Ô∏è Slower (overhead for reliability) | ‚ö° Very fast |
| **Header Size** | 20‚Äì60 bytes | 8 bytes (lightweight!) |
| **Use Cases** | Web (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP), File Transfer (FTP) | Live streaming, VoIP, Online gaming, DNS |
| **Port Examples** | 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 25 (SMTP) | 53 (DNS), 67/68 (DHCP), 123 (NTP) |

> üí° **Think**:  
> - **TCP** = Sending a *registered letter* ‚Äî you get confirmation it arrived.  
> - **UDP** = Throwing a *postcard into a crowd* ‚Äî fast, but hope it lands!

### üî¢ **Port Numbers: The App Address System**

The Transport Layer uses **port numbers** to direct data to the right application. Think of it like apartment numbers in a building (IP = building address, port = apartment #).

#### üè¢ Well-Known Port Ranges

| Range | Purpose | Examples |
|------|--------|---------|
| **0‚Äì1023** | üõ†Ô∏è **Well-known ports** ‚Äì assigned to core services | `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS), `21` (FTP), `25` (SMTP) |
| **1024‚Äì49151** | üß© **Registered ports** ‚Äì used by apps/services | `3306` (MySQL), `5432` (PostgreSQL), `8080` (HTTP alt) |
| **49152‚Äì65535** | üï∂Ô∏è **Dynamic/Private ports** ‚Äì temporary, client-side | Used when your browser connects to a server |

### **Error control** and **Error checking** are related but not the same thing.

### **Error Checking**
- Refers to the process of **detecting** errors in transmitted or stored data.
- It involves techniques like **parity checks**, **checksums**, and **cyclic redundancy checks (CRC)** to identify whether data has been corrupted during transmission.
- Example: A receiver calculates a checksum for an incoming packet and compares it to the checksum sent by the sender. If they don‚Äôt match, an error is detected.

### **Error Control**
- Is a **broader concept** that includes **error detection (checking)** and also **error correction and recovery**.
- Involves mechanisms to not only detect errors but also **correct** them or **retransmit** the data.
- Common methods include:
  - **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**: Requesting retransmission of corrupted data.
  - **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Using redundant data to reconstruct corrupted information without retransmission.

### **Key Difference**
- **Error checking** = *Detecting* that an error occurred.
- **Error control** = *Detecting, correcting, and/or recovering* from errors.

### **Example**
In a network protocol like TCP:
- **Error checking** is done using checksums in the header.
- **Error control** is achieved by retransmitting segments when errors are detected or acknowledgments are missing.

In summary, **error checking is a subset of error control**
