<h1 align="center">PHYSICAL LAYER 1</h1>

# ↙️ The Physical layer (PHY) of the OSI model is defined as layer 1.

# 🌐 OSI Model – **Layer 1: Physical Layer**  
🎯 *"The Foundation of Networking – Bits & Cables!"*

## 🧪 Physical layer (PHY) of the OSI model is defined as layer 1
 - Lowest layer of the OSI model providing for the transmission and receipt of data bits from node to node. This includes the network medium and mechanical and electrical specifications for using the media.

### 👉 Transmission media can be classified as cabled or wireless:
 - Cabled—A physical signal conductor is provided between two nodes. Examples include copper or fiber optic cable types. Cabled media can also be described as bounded media.
 - Wireless—Uses free space between nodes, such as microwave radio. Wireless media can also be described as unbounded media.

> ✅ **Exam Tip:** This layer is all about **raw bit transmission** and **physical connections**. Think: **"What moves the 1s and 0s?"**

---

## 📌 Key Responsibilities

- 🔌 **Transmits raw bitstream** over a physical medium (cables, wireless, etc.)
- 📡 Defines **electrical, mechanical, procedural**, and **functional** specifications
- 🧩 Handles **voltage levels, timing, data rates, cable types, connectors, and pin layouts**
   - 📌 These characteristics dictate the speed & bandwidth of a given medium
   - 📌 The maximun distance over which a certain media type can be used
- 🔄 Converts digital data into **electrical, optical, or radio signals**
- 🔄 Enables **synchronization** of bits (clocking)
- 🧱 Forms the **physical foundation** for all higher layers

## 🛠️ Physical Layer Components (Examples)

| Component        | Purpose / Example |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 🧵 **Cables**     | Twisted pair (Cat5e, Cat6), Coaxial, Fiber optic |
| 🔌 **Connectors** | RJ-45, BNC, LC/SC (fiber), DB-9 (serial) |
| 📶 **Network Interface Cards (NICs)** | Send/receive signals via physical medium |
| 📻 **Hubs & Repeaters** | Regenerate and forward signals (no intelligence) |
| 📡 **Wireless Access Points (APs)** | Transmit/receive radio waves (Wi-Fi) |
| 🌐 **Physical Topologies** | Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh (how devices are physically connected) |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Hubs and repeaters operate **only** at Layer 1 — they don’t read MAC/IP addresses.

---
### 🔧 Devices that operate at the Physical layer include the following:

| **Device** | **Function** | **How It Works** | **Real-World Example** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Transceiver** 🔁 | Sends and receives signals over network media | Converts digital data from a device into signals (electrical, optical, or radio) for transmission and vice versa | Built into NICs; also standalone (e.g., SFP modules in switches) |
| **Repeater** 🔊 | Amplifies or regenerates weak signals to extend cable distance | Receives a weak signal, cleans and boosts it, then retransmits it | Used in long Ethernet or fiber runs (e.g., between buildings) |
| **Hub** 🧩 | Multiport repeater; connects multiple devices in a star topology | Broadcasts incoming data on one port to *all* other ports (no filtering or intelligence) | Old office networks (mostly obsolete, replaced by switches) |
| **Media Converter** 🔀 | Converts one type of physical signal to another | Changes media type (e.g., copper to fiber) while preserving data | Connect a fiber backbone to a copper-based LAN |

---

### 🎯 Key Exam Tips:
- ✅ All these devices work with **raw bits** — they don’t read MAC or IP addresses.
- ❌ **Hubs and repeaters do NOT segment networks or reduce collisions** — they actually extend collision domains!
- 💡 **Media converters** help connect incompatible cabling types without changing higher-layer data.

### 🧠 Memory Trick:
> **"Layer 1 Devices = Dumb but Helpful!"**  
> They **boost**, **broadcast**, or **convert** signals — but never **decide**.

### 🎯 Key Takeaway:
> These technologies define **how bits travel physically** — through **wires, light, or radio waves**.  
> They are **Layer 1** because they handle **transmission, voltage, connectors, and timing** — not addressing or routing.

## 🔤 Encoding & Signaling

| Concept          | Description |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Encoding**     | How data is converted into signals (e.g., Manchester encoding) |
| **Signaling**    | Electrical/optical pulses representing bits (1s and 0s) |
| **Bandwidth**    | Data-carrying capacity (measured in bps – bits per second) |
| **Clocking**     | Synchronizes sender and receiver timing |

> 🎯 **Exam Tip:** If a question asks about **signal regeneration**, **cable types**, or **bit-level transmission**, think **Layer 1**.

## 🧪 Real-World Examples

- 🔌 Plugging an Ethernet cable into your laptop → **Physical Layer**
- 📶 Wi-Fi radio waves carrying data → **Physical Layer**
- 🧯 A broken fiber cable causing total link failure → **Physical Layer issue**
- 📏 Using Cat6a cable for 10 Gbps networks → **Physical Layer specification**

## ❌ What the Physical Layer Does **NOT** Do

- ❌ No error correction
- ❌ No addressing (MAC/IP)
- ❌ No routing or switching
- ❌ No data formatting or encryption

> 🚫 It only cares about **getting bits from Point A to Point B** — nothing else!
