<h1 align="center">Layer 1 Physical</h1>

# ‚ÜôÔ∏è The Physical layer (PHY) of the OSI model is defined as layer 1. 

 üëâ The Physical layer is responsible for the transmission and receipt of the signals that represent bits of data. Transmission media         can be classified as cabled or wireless:
  
üîå Cabled - Cabled‚ÄîA physical signal conductor is provided between two nodes. Examples include copper or fiber optic cable types.            Cabled media can also be described as bounded media.
  
üõú Wireless - Wireless‚ÄîUses free space between nodes, such as microwave radio. Wireless media can also be described as unbounded media.
  
## The Physical layer specifies the following:

  - **Physical topology**‚Äî  The layout of nodes and links as established by the transmission media. An area of a larger network is called       a segment. A network is typically divided into segments to cope with the physical restrictions of the network media used, to              improve performance, or to improve security. At the Physical layer, a segment is where all the nodes share access to the same media.

  - **Physical interface** ‚Äî Mechanical specifications for the network medium. For cabled media, this means the construction of the             cable, the interface/connector form factor, and the number and functions of the pins in a connector. For wireless media, it means         radio transceiver and antenna specifications.

  - **Signaling** ‚Äî The process of transmitting and receiving encoded data over the network medium. A modulation scheme describes how           electrical, light, or radio signals represent bits. Timing and synchronization schemes ensure senders and receivers can identify          groups of signals as a chunk or frame of data.

## üëáDevices that operate at the Physical layer include the following: 

- **Transceiver** - The part of a network interface that sends and receives signals over the network media.
      ( Component in a network interface that converts data to and from the media signalling type. Modular transceivers are designed to           plug into switches and routers. )

- **Repeater** - A device that amplifies an electronic signal to extend the maximum allowable distance for a media type.
      ( Layer 1 device that regenerates and retransmits signals to overcome media distance limitations. )

- **Hub** - A multiport repeater, deployed as the central point of connection for nodes
      ( Layer 1 (Physical) network device used to implement a star network topology on legacy Ethernet networks, working as a multiport           repeater.

- **Media converter** - A device that converts one media signaling type to another.
