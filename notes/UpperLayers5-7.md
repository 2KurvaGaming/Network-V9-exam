<h1 align="center">Upper Layers 5 - 7</h1>

# ☝️The upper layers of the OSI model are less clearly associated with distinct real-world protocols. 
  ## 🟠 These layers collect various functions that provide useful interfaces between software applications and the Transport layer.

# Layer 5️⃣ - Session
  📌 Most application protocols require the exchange of multiple messages between the client and server. 
  
  📌 This exchange of such a sequence of messages is called a ***Session or Dialog.

  📌 The Session layer (layer 5) represents functions that administer the process of establishing a dialog, managing data transfer, and then ending (or tearing down) the session.
   
 

  # Layer 6️⃣ - Presentation
  ⭐ Most application protocols require the exchange of multiple messages between the client and server. 
  
  ⭐ This exchange of such a sequence of messages is called a ***Session or Dialog.

  ⭐ The Session layer (layer 5) represents functions that administer the process of establishing a dialog, managing data transfer, and then ending (or tearing down) the session.



  # Layer 7️⃣ - Application
  📔 OSI model layer providing support to applications requiring network services (file transfer, printing, email, databases, and so on).
  
  📔 The Application layer (layer 7) is at the top of the OSI stack. An Application layer protocol doesn't encapsulate any other protocols or provide services to any protocol. 
  
  📔 Application layer protocols provide an interface for software programs on network hosts that have established a communications channel through the lower-level protocols to exchange data..

  📔 The Session layer (layer 5) represents functions that administer the process of establishing a dialog, managing data transfer, and then ending (or tearing down) the session.



## 👆 More widely, upper-layer protocols provide most of the services that make a network useful, rather than just functional, including web browsing, email and communications, directory lookup, remote printing, and database services.
