## 2 ‚ùì Which of the following BEST describes the effect that this will have on network communications? 
### üë£ You manage a network that's connected using a physical star topology. One of the drop cables connecting a workstation has been            removed.

- A. No devices will be able to communicate.  
- B. ‚úÖ **All devices except the device connected with the drop cable will be able to communicate**. ‚úÖ  
- C. Only devices on one side of the missing cable will be able to communicate with each other, while only devices on the other side        of the missing cable will be able to communicate with each other.  
- D. Devices on one side of the missing cable will be able to communicate with each other, while devices on the other side of the missing cable will not be able to communicate.  

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ B. All devices except the device connected with the drop cable will be able to communicate.** ‚úÖ
## Explanation
- A cable break in a star topology means that the device connected to the central device (hub or switch) through that cable can no longer communicate on the network.
- All other hosts will be able to communicate with all other devices.

## 3 ‚ùì What type of network would BEST meet your requirements?
### üë£ You own a small business and have decided to set up a network where each computer acts as both a client and a server.
  - This decentralized model should allow for the provisioning, management, and security of services and data that you want distributed around the network.

- A. Client-Server network  
- B. ‚úÖ Peer-to-Peer network ‚úÖ
- C. Virtual Private network
- D. Enterprise network

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ B. Peer-to-Peer network ‚úÖ**

**Explanation**  
- A Peer-to-Peer network would best meet your requirements. In a peer-to-peer network, each host acts as both a client and a server.      This is a decentralized model where provision, management, and security of services and data is distributed around the network, which   matches the scenario described.

- In a client-server network, servers are more powerful computers that make network applications and resources available to other         hosts, while clients consume the services provided by servers. This does not match the scenario described where each computer acts as   both a client and a server.

- A virtual private network (VPN) is a network that is constructed using public wires (usually the Internet) to connect to a private      network, such as a company's internal network. This does not match the scenario described where each computer acts as both a client     and a server.

- An enterprise network is a large corporate network that supports many users and comprises many different networks. The network setup    described in the scenario does not match the characteristics of an enterprise network.

## 4 ‚ùì Which of the following networking terms refers to the nodes that send and receive data traffic??

- A. Intermediate Nodes
- B. ‚úÖ End Systems ‚úÖ
- C. Network links
- D. Network Protocols

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ B. ***End Systems*** ‚úÖ**

**Explanation**  
- End systems, also referred to as hosts, are the nodes that send and receive data traffic in a network. They consume the services provided by servers in a client-server network.  
- Intermediate nodes perform a forwarding function in a network. They help to route the data but do not send or receive data traffic themselves.  
- Network links refer to the communication pathways between nodes in a network. They do not send or receive data traffic themselves.  
- Network protocols are sets of rules that govern data communication over a network. They do not send or receive data traffic.

## 5 ‚ùì Which type of network would be MOST suitable for this setup?
### üë£ A multinational corporation has its main office in New York and branch offices in London, Tokyo, and Sydney. The corporation             needs a network that can connect all these offices together, allowing for seamless communication and data transfer.

- A. Local Area Network (LAN)
- B. Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network
- C. Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network
- D. ‚úÖ Wide Area Network (WAN) ‚úÖ
- 
**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ D. ***Wide Area Network (WAN)*** ‚úÖ**

**Explanation**
- Wide Area Network (WAN) is the correct answer. A WAN is a network of networks, connected by long-distance links. A typical enterprise WAN would connect a main office site with multiple branch office sites, possibly in different countries. This is the most suitable type of network for a multinational corporation with offices in different countries.
- A Local Area Network (LAN) is confined to a single geographical location and all nodes and segments are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless technologies. It would not be suitable for connecting offices in different countries.
- A Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network is designed for a small number of users in a single location, often using a single Internet router/switch/access point to provide connectivity. It would not be suitable for connecting multiple offices in different countries.
- A Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) is designed to support dozens of users in a single location, using structured cabling and multiple switches and routers to provide connectivity. It would not be suitable for connecting multiple offices in different countries.

## 6 ‚ùì Which type of network would be MOST effective for this setup?
### üë£ A growing company has recently moved into a new office space. The company has 50 employees, each with their own workstation.            The office also has multiple printers, a centralized server, and requires structured cabling for connectivity.

- A. Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network
- B. Wide Area Network (WAN
- c. Data Center
- D. ‚úÖ Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network ‚úÖ

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ D. Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network ‚úÖ** 

**Explanation**
- A Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network is the correct answer. An SME network is designed to support dozens of users and      would use structured cabling and multiple switches and routers to provide connectivity. This is the most suitable type of network for a company with 50 employees.
- Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks are typically designed for smaller setups, often using a single Internet                       router/switch/access point to provide connectivity. A company with 50 employees would likely require a more robust network setup
- Wide Area Networks (WANs) are typically used to connect multiple networks over long distances, such as connecting a main office site with multiple branch office sites, possibly in different countries. This is not the case for a company with a single office.
- A data center is a network that hosts only servers and storage, not end user client devices. In this scenario, the office has end user client devices (the employees' workstations), so a data center would not be appropriate.

## 7 ‚ùì What type of network topology does this describe?
### üë£ Your company has a network where all devices can communicate with each other as if they were directly connected, regardless of          the physical connections. 

- A. Star Topology
- B. Mesh Topology
- C. ‚úÖ Logical Topology ‚úÖ
- D. Ring Topology

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ C. Logical Topology ‚úÖ**  

**Explanation**

- Logical topology is the correct answer. A logical topology describes the flow of data through the network. In the scenario, each device can send messages to any other device on the network, which is a characteristic of a logical topology.
- A star topology is a type of physical topology where each device on the network is connected to a central node or switch. While the scenario describes a network that physically resembles a star topology, the question is asking for the type of network topology that describes the flow of data, which is a logical topology
- In a mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device on the network. This is not the case in the scenario described.
- In a ring topology, each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a ring. This is not the case in the scenario described

## 8 ‚ùì What type of network topology does this describe?
- A. ‚úÖ Half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions, but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits simultaneous two-way data transmission. ‚úÖ
- B. Half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction, while full-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not at the same time.
- C. Full-duplex communication is limited to one direction at a time, similar to half-duplex, but it operates at higher speeds.
- D. Half-duplex communication uses a single cable for data transmission, whereas full-duplex requires separate cables for each direction.

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ A. Half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions, but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits                                simultaneous two-way data transmission. ‚úÖ**  

**Explanation**

- The correct answer is half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions, but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits simultaneous two-way data transmission.
- Half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction, while full-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions but not at the same time is incorrect. It inaccurately states that half-duplex communication can only occur in one direction. Half-duplex does allow for two-way communication, but with the limitation that it cannot happen simultaneously.
- Full-duplex communication is limited to one direction at a time, similar to half-duplex, but it operates at higher speeds is incorrect. It confuses the capabilities of full-duplex communication. Full-duplex systems can indeed transmit data in both directions simultaneously, not just one direction at a time. The speed of the communication is not the defining difference between half-duplex and full-duplex.
- Half-duplex communication uses a single cable for data transmission, whereas full-duplex requires separate cables for each direction is incorrect. It suggests that the use of separate cables is what differentiates half-duplex from full-duplex communication. The distinction between half-duplex and full-duplex is not about the number of cables used but about whether data transmission can occur simultaneously in both directions.

## 9 ‚ùìWhich of the following network topologies would BEST save power and scale easily to thousands of IoT sensor devices while               saving power by cooperating with nearby devices?
### üë£ A team of network consultants is configuring an Internet of Things (IoT) network. The team is considering network topologies in         the context of the IoT devices being used, which are all within 100 meters of one another, are battery-powered, and                    communicate via the Zigbee protocol.
  
- A. ‚úÖ MESH ‚úÖ
- B. STAR
- C. BUS
- D. RING

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ A. MESH ‚úÖ**

**Explanation**

- Mesh networks provide excellent redundancy, because other routes, via intermediary devices, are available between locations if a link failure occurs.
- In a star topology, each endpoint node is connected to a central forwarding node, such as a hub, switch, or router. The central node mediates communications between the endpoints.
- A physical bus topology is a shared access topology, meaning that all nodes share the bandwidth of the media. All nodes attach directly to a single cable segment via cable taps.
- In a physical ring topology, each node is wired to its neighbor in a closed loop. A node receives a transmission from its upstream neighbor and passes it to its downstream neighbor until the transmission reaches its intended destination.

## 10 ‚ùìWhich type of physical network topology have you implemented in this network?
### üë£ You've implemented an ad hoc wireless network that doesn't employ a wireless access point. Every wireless network card can              communicate directly with any other wireless network card on the network..

- A. BUS
- B. STAR
- C. RING
- D. ‚úÖ MESH ‚úÖ

**Correct Answer: ‚úÖ D. MESH ‚úÖ**

**Explanation**

- This type of network uses a physical mesh topology. A mesh topology has two key characteristics which are there is no central connecting point, and any host can communicate directly with any other host on the network.
- A mesh network is usually impractical on a wired network. Each host would require a separate dedicated network interface and cable. But you can implement a mesh topology with relative ease on a wireless network because wires aren't an issue.
- A ring topology connects neighboring nodes until they form a ring. Signals travel in one direction around the ring
- A star topology uses a hub or switch to connect all network connections to a single physical location.
- A bus topology consists of a trunk cable with nodes either inserted directly into the trunk or tapped in with offshoot cables called drop cables.
